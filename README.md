## Assignment 1

Use:

```bash
$ ruby process_database.rb  gene_information.tsv  seed_stock_data.tsv  cross_data.tsv  new_stock_file.tsv
```

## Assignment 2

This script takes a list of genes and creates interactions networks with the genes, searching for interactions in IntAct Database, and then annotates the networks with a KEGG pathway and GO terms

Use:
```bash
$ ruby main.rb gene_file.txt output.txt [intact-miscore] [depth]
```
- gene_file.txt: file containing the list of genes
- output.txt: file to save the output
- \[intact-miscore]\(optional): minimum score to consider an interaction. Value between 0 and 1. The recommended value is 0.45, which is the default value in the script.
- \[depth]\(optional): the deapth of the search. Value can go from 1 to 3 (values bigger than 3 take too much time), 1 being direct interaction, 2 interaction by one intermediate gene that is not on the list and 3 interaction by two intermediate genes.
*The intermediate genes are not printed in the output.
